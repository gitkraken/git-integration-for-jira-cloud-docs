Congratulations! You have successfully completed your base GIJ configuration. The following features and free add-on extension applications aren't required for GIJ to operate, but they provide additional value on top of the base functionality. We recommend exploring them.

We have created an [End User Guide](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/End-User-Guide-cloud/) that you can share with your users.

&nbsp;

## Feature: Automation for Jira Triggers

GIJ provides triggers for the built-in Jira Automation system. Use these triggers to create automation rules that perform actions such as issue transitions or adding comments based on events in your repositories.

See [GIJ + Jira Automation](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/git-integration-jira-automation-gij-cloud/) for further details.

## Add-on Extension Applications

### CI/CD for Jira

CI/CD for Jira displays build and deployment data in Jira. Note that CI/CD only supports builds and deployments created through the same Git service as your integrations. Builds and deployments created through external services are not supported.

- [CI/CD for Jira Marketplace Listing](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228578/ci-cd-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) - Install the application

### Team Insights for Jira

Team Insights for Jira is a free standalone application designed for planning and sprint work management. While it works independently, you can use it alongside GIJ to view development information inside Team Insights, providing a clearer view of work progress.

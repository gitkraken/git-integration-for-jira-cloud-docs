Trusted users have administrative permissions for the Git Integration for Jira app. They can see all pages of the app and invite other users.

## Understand Trusted Users

When you assign the **Trusted** role to a user:

- The user gains administrative permissions for the [Git Integration for Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) app
- The user can see all pages of the Git Integration app
- The user can invite other users
- Adding this user to the `jira-administrators` group does not change their Git Integration app access because the Trusted role already grants equivalent permissions

Jira administrators can grant the Trusted role when inviting users and can change roles later according to organizational requirements.

2.  View pricing details on the [Atlassian Marketplace: Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing).

3.  Install the [Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing) then go to `https://replace-with-your-Jira-Org-Name.atlassian.net/admin/billing/estimate`. The estimated monthly or annual price will be quoted.

For details on supported Jira versions, browser compatibility, service limitations, and end-of-life policies, see [Support & Compatibility Information](https://help.gitkraken.com).

GitKraken makes every reasonable effort to meet response timelines but is not liable for delays resulting from customer-side issues or events outside our control.

## Scope of Technical Support

With an active support plan, GitKraken provides assistance with:

- **Installation issues** – Initial setup and deployment
- **Upgrade issues** – Version upgrades of the app
- **Troubleshooting** – Diagnosis and resolution of errors or unexpected behavior
- **Configuration reviews** – Virtual meetings (for eligible plans) to review and optimize your setup

&nbsp;

## Support Exceptions and Limitations

GitKraken resolves issues promptly and professionally in alignment with SLAs. However, certain requests fall outside standard support scope.

**This SLA does not cover:**

- Product training
- Support requests for licenses without active License Maintenance agreement
- Customers using the app beyond [stated usage limits](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/gij-standard-vs-advanced/)

During troubleshooting, we may recommend upgrading to a different edition if usage exceeds your current plan's limits.

**We cannot provide assistance for:**

- Apps not developed by GitKraken
- Issues related to Atlassian Confluence
- Confluence versions not supported by GitKraken apps
- Unsupported client configurations
- Beta or development versions of our apps
- Support in languages other than English

&nbsp;

## Platform Compatibility and Customer Responsibilities

GitKraken follows [Atlassian's official End of Life (EOL) policies](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html) and expects customers to maintain compatible environments.

### Self-Managed Jira (Data Center)

GitKraken's support policy aligns with Atlassian's EOL guidelines. Atlassian supports each feature version for two years after release. GitKraken extends support for at least the same duration and may support older Jira versions when technically feasible.

See the [Atlassian Marketplace Versions Page](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira/version-history) for version compatibility details.

### Jira Cloud

GitKraken adheres to Atlassian's deprecation and support timelines for Jira Cloud, monitoring and adapting to platform changes for continued compatibility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is the acquisition happening? Why GitKraken (formerly Axosoft)?**

As BigBrassBand's customer base has grown to over 10,000+ customers worldwide, teams now rely more than ever on Git productivity to deliver services and applications. GitKraken is the favored Git desktop client among developers, with over 2.5M users globally. By joining GitKraken, teams using Git and Jira in their DevOps workflows will now have the option to transition between multiple developer workspaces with access to all the Git repo information and actions they need in whichever context they're working in.

[Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) (GIJ) seamlessly combines Git data and workflows into a Jira team's project and issue-oriented context while GitKraken presents Jira issues and projects to developers in a highly visual developer-oriented Git environment. Together the two products will improve how teams interact with Git. BigBrassBand will continue to invest in the Atlassian Marketplace to bring the best-selling Git integration for Jira product to thousands of software development teams by investing in additional capabilities, performance, reliability, and security.
